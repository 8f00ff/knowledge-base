## Attribution Requirements

This project follows specific attribution guidelines that MUST be maintained in all derivatives and forks.

### ATTRIBUTIONS.md Structure

#### Maintainers

Current active maintainers only. Original authors should NOT be listed here unless actively maintaining this fork. Temporary PR forks (intended to be merged & deleted) don't need to modify this section, but long-term or permanent forks MUST update it to reflect actual maintainers.

#### Original Authors

Original creators of the project. This section MUST remain intact and unmodified in ALL derivatives and forks.

#### Additional Contributors

All original contributors MUST be kept, new ones may be appended. PR authors should add themselves here.

#### Supporters

All original supporters MUST be preserved, new ones may be appended.

### Donation Links Policy

- Original creator donation/support links, if any exist, MUST always be maintained in all derivatives.
- Derivative works may include their own donation/support links.
- Derivative creator links may be positioned above original creator links, but original links must remain present and functional.

### In-Game Credits / UI

- Any credits screen or about page MUST maintain attribution to original creators.
- Format: "Originally created by [ORIGINAL AUTHORS]. See ATTRIBUTIONS.md for full credits."

### Fork Responsibility

- Original authors reserve the right to request correction of attribution in any fork that misrepresents maintainer status.
- "PR-only" forks that become long-term projects MUST update the Maintainers section to accurately reflect who is actively maintaining the fork.

**Using this project constitutes agreement to follow these attribution guidelines.**

## Implementation Instructions

1. **Create an ATTRIBUTIONS.md file** in your project root with these sections:
    
    ```markdown
    # ATTRIBUTIONS
    
    ## Maintainers
    * [Your Name] - Project creator and lead maintainer
    # For forks, replace with current maintainers. PR forks don't need to modify this.
    
    ## Original Authors
    * [Your Name] - Project creator and lead maintainer
    # This section should remain unchanged in all derivatives and forks
    
    ## Additional Contributors
    * None yet - be the first!
    # New contributors can be added here - PR authors should add themselves here
    
    ## Supporters
    * [Optional: List your supporters, donors, etc.]
    # New supporters can be added here while preserving original ones
    ```
    
2. **Add a License Section** in your README.md that references both the license and attribution requirements:
    
    ```markdown
    ## License
    
    This project is licensed under [LICENSE NAME] - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
    
    This project also has specific attribution requirements - see the [Attribution Requirements](#attribution-requirements) section.
    ```
    
3. **Include in your splash screen/credits** (for games):
    
    ```
    Originally created by [YOUR NAME]
    See ATTRIBUTIONS.md for full credits
    ```
